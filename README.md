Upload your real-life photo and add the [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) user interface over the top!

This is all done in the browser using React and HTML Canvas, without the need for a server to compose
the image. I didn't know this was possible until I started this project, but it turns out Canvas
is pretty powerful and well supported.

Made in a day, and hosted with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) which is a great way of hosting front-end apps.

Styled without writing any CSS using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which is awesome.
